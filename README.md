# distributive_property

## Overview

This interactive will show students how the distributive property works in a very visual and animated way. Students should be able to navigate between steps with `<` and `>` buttons.

## How it Works

### Step 1

A random expression that follows the format `a(b + c)` is shown. `a`, `b`, and `c` should only be natural numbers.

### Step 2

Next arrows will appear to distribute `a` across `b` and `c`. The student is able to drag `a` across these arrows (once each).
As `a` is being dragged, it shows up as `a ×`. Once its dragged to its destination, those parts of the expression will update to `a×b` and `a×c` respectively.
After the second `a` has begun to be moved, the `a` at the beginning of the expression can finally hide.

### Step 3

The numbers will automatically animate to do their respective multiplications.
Once the multiplication is done, it's complete! No need to perform the addition.

## Overview
This interactive will help students solve a generated two step equation by dragging the terms from one side of the equation to the other.

## How it works

### Step 1
- A random two step equation is shown in the form `ax + b = c`. 
- `a`, `b`, and `c` can be integers between -10 and 10. If `b` is negative, have the expression use `-` instead of `+`.
-  Also allow for `a` to be a fraction with a numerator of 1. In these cases, have the expression display x over the denominator.
- Ensure that the final answer `x` will always be an integer.

### Step 2
- Next, the `+b` part of the expression and can be dragged. Once picked up, it will leave behind a grey `+b` where it started. 
- Once the `+b` is dragged past the equals sign, it will become its opposite `-b`.
- At the same time it crosses, a grey `-b` will appear underneath the grey `+b`. Also, another grey `-b` will appear on the right side of the equation to show where the dragged object should end up. 
- Letting go of the `-b` anywhere on the right side of the equals sign will have it snap to that right side where its ghost is. 
- Once released, the grey parts on the left side will animate to cancel each other out. Then the right side will animate to simplify

### Step 3
- Repeat the above step but this time with the multiplication/division step with `a`. 
- When dragging a division term, let it show as `÷a` rather than a fraction bar. The fraction bar can stay on the left side of the equation as it was.
- Once everything is simplified, the interactive is complete!
