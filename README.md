# two_step_equations

## Overview
This interactive will help students solve a generated two step equation by dragging the terms from one side of the equation to the other.

## How it works

### Step 1
- A random two step equation is shown in the form `ax + b = c`. 
- `a`, `b`, and `c` can be integers between -10 and 10. If `b` is negative, have the expression use `-` instead of `+`.
-  Also allow for `a` to be a fraction with a numerator of 1. In these cases, have the expression display x over the denominator.
- Ensure that the final answer `x` will always be an integer.

### Step 2
- Next, the `+b` part of the expression and can be dragged. Once picked up, it will leave behind a grey `+b` where it started. 
- Once the `+b` is dragged past the equals sign, it will become its opposite `-b`.
- At the same time it crosses, a grey `-b` will appear underneath the grey `+b`. Also, another grey `-b` will appear on the right side of the equation to show where the dragged object should end up. 
- Letting go of the `-b` anywhere on the right side of the equals sign will have it snap to that right side where its ghost is. 
- Once released, the grey parts on the left side will animate to cancel each other out. Then the right side will animate to simplify

### Step 3
- Repeat the above step but this time with the multiplication/division step with `a`. 
- When dragging a division term, let it show as `÷a` rather than a fraction bar. The fraction bar can stay on the left side of the equation as it was.
- Once everything is simplified, the interactive is complete!
